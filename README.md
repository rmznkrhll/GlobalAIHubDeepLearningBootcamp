# GlobalAIHubDeepLearningBootcamp
I made a project on the classification of sounds heard in cities using the “UrbanSounds8K” dataset within the scope of the Deep Learning Bootcamp organized by Global AI Hub and Koç Holding. My goal in this project is to prepare an artificial intelligence model using deep learning algorithms.
