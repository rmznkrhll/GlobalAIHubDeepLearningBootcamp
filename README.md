# GlobalAIHubDeepLearningBootcamp
I made a project on the classification of sounds heard in cities using the “UrbanSounds8K” dataset within the scope of the Deep Learning Bootcamp organized by Global AI Hub and Koç Holding. My goal in this project is to prepare an artificial intelligence model using deep learning algorithms.

Using the dataset from "https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html" I created spectrograms from the audio files and recorded them according to their respective categories. Then I prepared a CNN model by preprocessing these images and trained this model.
